# Horse-Race-program
This program simulates a 5-round tournament of horse races.

At the beginning of the tournament, the user is given $100 and is asked to make a bet each race on which horse they think will win (Horse 0, Horse 1, Horse 2, Horse 3, or Horse 4). 
The betting starts at $10 and each subsequent game, the betting amount is increased. 
If the horse the user chooses loses, the amount they bet on that race is subtracted from their balance, and if the horse they choose wins, they get the amount added to their balance instead.
During each race a visual of the race-track is printed to the console after every round of movement.

This program uses Object-Oriented Programming in C++, with the Horses, Race and Tournament each being their own object.
